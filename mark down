## Project Overview
This project explores password security by deploying and testing an open-source
password strength checker from GitHub. The goal was to understand how weak passwords
are identified and how users can create stronger authentication credentials.

## Software and Tools Used
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code
- Git
- Zxcvbn Password Strength Library
- GitHub

## Key Deliverables
- Medium Article Draft (in /final-paper)
- Password Strength Tool Deployment
- Step-by-Step Setup Guide
- Weekly Progress Documentation

## Repository Navigation
- `/weekly-progress/` – Weekly assignments and reflections
- `/resources/` – All research sources used
- `/src/` – Cloned project and code
- `/docs/` – Setup and usage documentation
- `/final-paper/` – Medium article draft and research notes
- `/images/` – Screenshots and visuals

## Getting Started
Clone the repository, install Python dependencies, and follow the setup guide
located in `/docs/SETUP-GUIDE.md`.

## Results Summary
This project demonstrated that password length and randomness matter more than
symbols alone. The tool successfully identified weak passwords and reinforced
best practices recommended by cybersecurity standards.
