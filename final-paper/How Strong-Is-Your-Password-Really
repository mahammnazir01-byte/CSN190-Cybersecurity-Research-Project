## Project Overview
This project explores password security by deploying and testing an open-source password strength checker from GitHub. Using a Python-based application powered by the Zxcvbn library, I analyzed common passwords, passphrases, and randomly generated credentials to understand how password strength is evaluated against real-world attack techniques.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project, install Python 3 and Git, clone this repository, and install the required dependency using `pip install zxcvbn`. Navigate to the cloned project directory and run the program with `python password.py`. Detailed instructions are available in the setup guide located in the `/docs/` folder.

## Results Summary
This project demonstrated that password length and randomness have a far greater impact on security than the use of symbols alone. Common passwords and keyboard patterns were identified as extremely weak and cracked almost instantly, while long passphrases and randomly generated passwords provided significantly stronger protection. Through this work, I gained hands-on experience with defensive cybersecurity tools and developed a stronger understanding of authentication security and attacker behavior.
