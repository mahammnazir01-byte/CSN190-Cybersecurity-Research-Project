against ML systems in cybersecurity, outlines attacker goals and
capabilities, and proposes a taxonomy mapping attacks and
corresponding defenses in security contexts. The paper also
discusses the unique challenges of deploying adversarial ML in realworld security systems (e.g. discrete feature spaces, constrained
attacker modifications).

-5. Relevance Rating: 5/5This is a foundational survey specifically targeted at adversarial ML in
cybersecurity, making it extremely central to your topic. Its taxonomy
and critique of deployment challenges are especially valuable.
-Limitations:• It is a survey rather than novel original research, so it may not include
the most recent developments post-2020.Some defense proposals may be theoretical and not validated in
large-scale real-world systems.

Neural Networks. arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.04508. Retrieved from
https://arXiv.org/abs/1511.04508 (arXiv)
-2. Resource Type:Academic Article
-3. Synopsis:This article introduces defensive distillation as a technique to
reduce the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial
perturbations. The authors show that distilling knowledge from a
DNN can smooth out gradients exploited by attackers, dramatically
lowering adversarial success rates in tested settings.
-4. Direct Link:https://arXiv.org/abs/1511.04508 (arXiv)
-5. Relevance Rating: 4/5 While not specific to cybersecurity per se, this is a seminal work in
adversarial defense and helps you understand core defense .mechanisms applicable across domains (including security)
-Limitations:• The experiments are largely in image domain (vision), so some
conclusions may not transfer cleanly to discrete, structured, or
domain-constrained data (e.g. network traffic).• Later works have found that distillation can be circumvented by more
advanced adversarial strategies.

learning: definitions, adversary motivations, threat models,
mitigation strategies, and how robustness is achieved. It also
presents a taxonomy of attack vectors and defense techniques.

-5. Relevance Rating: 4/5 This is more technical and structured than the first video. Useful for
quickly getting up to speed and mapping out the landscape of
adversarial ML.
-Limitations:• Because it is an overview, it cannot cover every nuance or variation of
attacks/defenses. • It might not focus specifically on cybersecurity domains (intrusion,
malware, etc.), so some adaptation is required.

-3. Synopsis: This study compares static and dynamic analysis for Android malware
detection using behavioral modeling. The authors extend MaMaDroid (a
static analysis system) into AuntieDroid (dynamic) to analyze API call
sequences during runtime. Results show that static analysis can be
comparable to dynamic methods under certain conditions, and combining
both improves accuracy. This work provides valuable data driven insights
into mobile malware detection.
Limitations: focuses only on Android malware and does not include
advanced obfuscation or polymorphic threats.

-5. Relevance Rating: 5/5 – Directly addresses static vs. dynamic analysis through empirical
testing, offering clear comparisons and hybrid insights.
