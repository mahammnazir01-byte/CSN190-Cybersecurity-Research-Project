2. Resource Type:Academic Article
3. Synopsis:This study compares static and dynamic analysis for Android malware
detection using behavioral modeling. The authors extend MaMaDroid (a
static analysis system) into AuntieDroid (dynamic) to analyze API call
sequences during runtime. Results show that static analysis can be
comparable to dynamic methods under certain conditions, and combining
both improves accuracy. This work provides valuable data driven insights
into mobile malware detection.
Limitations: focuses only on Android malware and does not include
advanced obfuscation or polymorphic threats.

5. Relevance Rating:5/5 – Directly addresses static vs. dynamic analysis through empirical
testing, offering clear comparisons and hybrid insights.

3. Synopsis:This paper performs an experimental comparison of static, dynamic, and
hybrid malware analysis using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It evaluates
detection accuracy across various malware families and explores tradeoffs between the methods. The authors demonstrate that hybrid models
generally outperform either static or dynamic techniques alone. The paper
provides datasets and feature extraction tools for replication.
Limitations: focuses on HMMs rather than modern deep learning models,
and experiments are limited to specific datasets that may not reflect
current malware trends.

5. Relevance Rating:5/5 – Offers comprehensive experimental comparisons and reproducible
methods ideal for hands on malware research.

dynamic) [Video]. YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlE2llZwjZQ
2. Resource Type:You Tube Video
3. Synopsis:This video demonstrates both static and dynamic malware analysis using
the WannaCry ransomware. Screeck uses tools such as PE Studio, FLOSS,
and Process Monitor to identify strings, API calls, and behavioral indicators.
Static analysis reveals encrypted functions and persistence mechanisms,
while dynamic analysis shows file encryption, network activity, and registry
modifications within a virtual lab. The video offers an accessible, step-bystep walkthrough of real-world malware investigation techniques.
Limitations include an informal presentation style, lack of peer review, and
minimal code-level analysis. Despite this, it’s a valuable visual learning
resource for beginners in malware analysis.

5. Relevance Rating:5/5 – Highly relevant to the topic of malware analysis. The video clearly
illustrates both static and dynamic investigation methods, showing how
ransomware operates in real-time while highlighting safe lab procedures. It
complements academic reading by providing practical demonstrations of
analysis tools and techniques.

2. Resource Type:YouTube Video
3. Synopsis:This video provides a detailed reverse engineering walkthrough of the
WannaCry ransomware. Psyrun explains how to analyze the malware’s
encryption and propagation methods using debugging and dynamic
monitoring tools such as x64dbg, ProcMon, and sandbox environments.
The video balances theoretical explanation with practical demonstration,
helping viewers understand both static and behavioral analysis. While
highly informative, it assumes moderate technical knowledge and skips
some deep assembly-level steps. Overall, it is a clear, engaging, and
technically grounded resource for learning malware dissection and
ransomware behavior analysis.

5. Relevance Rating5/5 – Extremely relevant to the topic of malware analysis. It complements
other resources by introducing reverse engineering tools and showing live
debugging of ransomware in a controlled lab. This visual demonstration
reinforces theoretical knowledge with practical application.
