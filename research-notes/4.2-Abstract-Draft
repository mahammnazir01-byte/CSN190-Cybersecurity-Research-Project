###Static vs. Dynamic Malware Analysis Techniques
##Abstract
The continuous appearance of new malware samples at a rate of millions per month makes malware
the leading cybersecurity threat. Security experts perform malware analysis to study malicious
program behavior for developing enhanced protection systems. The evaluation of static versus
dynamic analysis methods for evasive malware detection and understanding remains an unresolved
issue. The research investigates static and dynamic malware analysis methods through a
combination of theoretical analysis and practical implementation to determine their relative strengths
and weaknesses and analytical precision. The research will evaluate 50 actual malware examples
through controlled sandbox testing with PEiD and IDA Pro, and Cuckoo Sandbox tools. The static
analysis method examines code content through signature-based detection, while dynamic analysis
monitors system changes and runtime activities. The evaluation process will assess detection
success rates and analysis duration, and ability to withstand encryption attempts. The research will
establish a performance evaluation between the two methods and develop guidelines for their
successful integration in operational cybersecurity systems. The research advances malware
research by providing analysts with a method to select the best analysis approach for handling
unfamiliar threats.

##Adversarial Machine Learning in Cybersecurity
###Abstract
Machine learning serves as a fundamental security tool for cybersecurity operations because it
enables malware detection and intrusion prevention and phishing identification systems. The same
models which power cybersecurity systems face vulnerability to adversarial attacks because
attackers use small deliberate data modifications to produce incorrect model predictions. The
research explores the increasing danger of adversarial machine learning attacks against
cybersecurity systems while assessing their ability to evade current protection mechanisms. The
research combines academic theory with practical testing through Python-based frameworks
including secml_malware and TensorFlow. The research will create adversarial examples to evaluate
the resistance of MalConv and other machine learning classifiers which use neural networks for
malware detection. The research will conduct white-box and black-box attacks to evaluate their
effectiveness through measurements of detection accuracy and model confidence and evasion
success rates. The research aims to discover how adversarial attacks impact cybersecurity systems
while creating methods to enhance system defenses through model retraining and adversarial
hardening techniques. The research unites theoretical machine learning knowledge with practical
cybersecurity problems to demonstrate why developers need to create AI systems that resist
adversarial attacks.
